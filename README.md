# pomodoro

The Pomodoro timer, also known as the Pomodoro Technique, is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s1. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks231. The term “pomodoro” refers to any timer you can use to track your work, and can also be used as a unit of measure for 25-minute segments.

# The original technique has six steps:

1- Decide on the task to be done.
2- Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes)."allready setted"
3- Work on the task.
4- End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes)."allready setted 5 minutes"
5- Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
6- After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes)"allready setted 20 minutes" instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
